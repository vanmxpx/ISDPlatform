# Oracle DB tuning guide

This guide helps to configure Oracle DB for Cooper project.

## Installation Oracle Database 18c and creation of connection to a database

1. Download [Oracle Database 18c](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html).
2. Install Oracle Database 18c by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrTo_XoDQwI).
3. Download [SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html) and run it.
4. Click on green "+" to create a new connection.

6. Click on the connect button at the bottom of the window.

**Congratulations, you have created the database connection:)**

## Creating tables and adding data in these table

1. Click on the "+" on the left of the newly created database connection.
2. After connecting to the database you will have a worksheet. You must insert [this query](https://github.com/vanmxpx/ISDPlatform/blob/feature/OracleDBTuningGuide/Documentation/Database/Cooper.Sql) into this worksheet and press Cltr + Enter to run script.
<br/>**Note: If you have a error *"The ORA-01858 error "a non-numeric character was located where a digit was expected."*, go to *Tools>Preferences* and enter "nls" in the search. After that, configure everything as in the screenshot below.**
![Change NLS](https://github.com/vanmxpx/ISDPlatform/blob/feature/OracleDBTuningGuide/Documentation/Database/ScreenshotsForGuide/change_nls.png)
**After configuring the NLS, delete all tables with the query below and execute [this query](https://github.com/vanmxpx/ISDPlatform/blob/feature/OracleDBTuningGuide/Documentation/Database/Cooper.Sql) one more time.**
```sql
DROP TABLE USERSGAMES;
DROP TABLE CREATORSGAMES;
DROP TABLE USERSCONNECTIONS;
DROP TABLE GAMESSTATISTICS;
DROP TABLE GAMESREVIEWS;
DROP TABLE USERSREVIEWS;
DROP TABLE USERSCHATS;
DROP TABLE GAMES;
DROP TABLE MESSAGES;
DROP TABLE CHATS;
DROP TABLE USERS;
```
3. You have created the necessary tables, you are well done. But now you need to fill them with data. To do this, simply run [this query](https://github.com/vanmxpx/ISDPlatform/blob/feature/OracleDBTuningGuide/Documentation/Database/InsertBasicInfo.Sql).

**Congratulations, you have created the tables and added some data to them:)**

## Adding an environment variable

For specify a password in the connection string, we use environment variables.

1. Open the Start Search, type in "env", and choose "Edit the system environment variables".
2. Click the "Environment Variablesâ€¦" button.
3. Now you can add a user environment variable to Windows with the name "Coop" and the password that you specified during installation Oracle Database 18c.
